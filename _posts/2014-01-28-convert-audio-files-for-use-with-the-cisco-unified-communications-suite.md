title: Convert Audio Files for use with the Cisco Unified Communications Suite
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
--- 

## Quick Note:

I thought I would make a quick post around how I prepare audio files for deployment in Unity Connection, Communications Manager, Contact Center Express, and other Cisco UC[[1]](1 "see footnote") products. This post will be focused around Unity Connections but the same method can be used for all applications.

## The Request:

Due to inclement weather conditions in the southeast I had multiple clients that needed emergency messages uploaded to their Unity Connection auto attendants. I have some clients that have call handler managers and record and configure their own messages on the systems. But, I have quite a few that would much rather just record a message with whatever is handy (an iPhone more and more these days) and e-mail it to me for uploading and configuration.

## The Solution:

I like to use the [Switch application by NCH Software](http://www.nch.com.au/switch/index.html) for this task. For the amount of time I spend performing this task I find the software to be extremely easy to use, accepting of every format I have thrown at it, and relatively inexpensive. I thought the best way to show how to do this would be by shooting a quick video: http://youtu.be/liPCTVBRWT4 Also here is a quick screen shot of the settings for the WAV conversion so it will be in the format Cisco likes! I know we have all run into this especially with things like music on hold… [![Audio_Conversion](http://thenetworkhobo.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/audio_canversion.png)](http://thenetworkhobo.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/audio_canversion.png)

## Conclusion:

This is just a short post on a topic I am asked about often. I am sure there are MANY different ways to accomplish this task using many different tools and methods. I would love for you all to share your method in the comments so we can all learn!
