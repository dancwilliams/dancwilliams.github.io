# **Hi! I Am Dan!**

I have been in the networking field for over 10 years now. I have specialized in voice for most of this time but have also done quite a bit in the route/switch arena as well. These days you will find me digging around in the data center and working neck deep in the land of Nexus and UCS.

You can find me on LinkedIn by clicking [he](http://www.linkedin.com/in/danielcwilliams "Dan C on LinkedIN")[re](http://www.linkedin.com/in/danielcwilliams "Dan C on LinkedIN")!
